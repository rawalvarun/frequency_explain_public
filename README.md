### Architecture

| Architecture \ Task | Attribution                                  | Robust Dataset | Adversarial Attack |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------ |
| Model One           | ResNet (pytorch pertained)                   |  cifar_test_non_robust              |   NA                 |
| Model Two           | ResNet ($ \delta_2=0.25 $, Madry pertained )   |  cifar_test_robust              |       PGD             |
| Model Three         | ResNet ($\delta_2=0.5$, Madry pertained )    |                |          PGD          |

The simple-black-box-attack is copied from https://github.com/cg563/simple-blackbox-attack, with some modifications to adapt the CIFAR-10 dataset.
To run the simple-black-box-attack, some additional files are required, which can be download from: . Simply unzip the downloaded .tar file before running.

Robustness package is need to conduct the simple-black-box-attack, which can be installed by:

`pip install robustness`

The command to run the attack on cifar10 is:

`python run_simba.py --data_root cifar10 --num_runs 10000 --num_iters 10000 --pixel_attack  --freq_dims 32`

Change --num_runs to attack different number of images.
